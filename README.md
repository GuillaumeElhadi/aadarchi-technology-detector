### üè† [Homepage](https://github.com/Riduidel/aadarchi-technology-detector)

## Prerequisites

. Install [jbang](https://www.jbang.dev/)
. Clone [TechEmpower frameworks](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/) repository beside this repository

## Usage

### Fetching data from reports branches

This repository provides for each observed repository one branch containing in a given folder the file
aggregating all informations.

#### Available sources

| Source website    | Branch name           | Path of artifacts file(s)    |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| mvnrepository.com | reports_mvnrepository | mvnrepository/artifacts.json |

If you take a look at these branches, 
in each of them, you'll find one commit per week (or per month for history).

### Command line

Each process can be run on your machine to validate everything is good

#### MvnRepository

```
cd mvnrepository
jbang ExtractPopularMvnRepositorytArtifacts.java
```

It will produce an `artifacts.json` file with the artifacts usage count at the time the command is run

##### Extract MvnRepository
Thanks to the Internet Wayback Machine, it is possible to get the whole history for mvn repository by running the command

```
jbang ExtractPopularMvnRepositorytArtifacts.java --generate-history
```

This will fetch the whole history for MvnRepository and generate in a branch called history one commit for each month since the first capture available at https://archive.org.
This code is kept for tracability reason, to make sure the history fetching process is reproducable, but should not be run.
